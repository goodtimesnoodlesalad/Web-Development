# Web Development
I've been "dabbling" in programming and web development since discovering the world of personal websites (Geocities, anyone?) on Web 1.0 back in the late 1990s, when I was barely in middle school. Although I never pursued formal education or a full-time career in computer science, having some knowledge about how the web works has served me well in transitioning to a working world that is almost entirely digital.

## WordPress
I've used the WordPress platform since 2009 to publish a number of projects, including <a href="http://verbict.com">verb[ICT]</a> and <a href="http://theflyover.net">The Flyover</a>, picking up a fair amount of CSS, PHP, and MySQL knowledge along the way. In 2014 and 2015, I helped authors <a href="http://stacyennis.com">Stacy Ennis</a> and <a href="http://haydnshaughnessy.com">Haydn Shaughnessy</a> upgrade their online presences with customized WordPress themes and plugin integrations.

I completed the <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/freelance-wordpress-developer-2/">Skillcrush WordPress Development Blueprint</a> in 2016.

## Coursework
I've been involved with the Cincinnati chapter of <a href="http://gdicincinnati.com">Girl Develop It</a> since 2012. As a student, I've completed the <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/materials/intro-web">Intro to Web Concepts</a>, <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/materials/html-intro">Intro to HTML/CSS</a>, and <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/materials/intro-js">Intro to Javascript/jQuery</a> courses; as a teaching assistant, I've helped instruct Intro to HTML/CSS, <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/materials/inter-html">Intermediate HTML/CSS</a>, and <a href="http://gdi.johndavidback.com/python/#/">Intro to Python</a>.

In 2014, I completed two introductory Ruby courses: one in person with <a href="https://teamgaslight.com/training/courses/9-introduction-to-ruby-on-rails">Gaslight</a>, and the other online with <a href="https://skillcrush.com/program/learn-ruby/">Skillcrush</a>.
